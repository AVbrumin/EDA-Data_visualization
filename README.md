## Exploratory data analysis and data visualization

This the second project in my portfolio.

In this project I conducted a deep analysis of a [public dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+Retail) containing online store transactions for one year of work. In the course of the work, information was obtained on the amount of revenue, the volume of write-offs, the number of orders, the percentage of canceled orders, the most popular products, the links between the purchased goods, the most valuable customers, etc.

The goal of the project is to demonstrate mastery of the following skills and tools:
- processing, verification, cleaning of data;
- exploratory data analysiss;
- data visualization using Python (Matplotlib, Seaborn).
